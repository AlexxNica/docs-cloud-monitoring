Cloud Monitoring release notes v1.7, July 03, 2014Â 
================================================================


These release notes correspond to a New Feature release of Cloud
Monitoring.

**New Features**

-  Server-side configuration is now available. For details, see `Install
   and Configure section of the Cloud Monitoring Getting Started
   Guide </cm/api/v1.0/cm-getting-started/content/install-configure.html#agent-config-file>`__.

   Server-side configuration allows checks and alarms to be configured
   using a YAML file. Users must update their monitoring agent to take
   advantage of this new feature.

   This is an API-only feature that is available globally without regard
   to region.

   -  Small logging adjustments for easier reading.
