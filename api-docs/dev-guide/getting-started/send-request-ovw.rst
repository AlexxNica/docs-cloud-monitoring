Send requests to the API
------------------------------------------

This Getting Started Guide shows how to send requests by using cURL.

.. note::
      For API development, testing and workflow management in a graphical environment, try
      interacting with the Rackspace Metrics APIs by using an application such as
      `Postman`_  or `RESTClient for Firefox`_.
