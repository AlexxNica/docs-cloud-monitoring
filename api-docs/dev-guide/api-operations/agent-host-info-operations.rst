Agent host information
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Host Info requests can be used to gather information about an
entity, or to build your own dashboards. This information is
gathered on demand to make sure you have the most recent data.
Some of the data that can be enumerated includes: operating
system info, process lists, network configuration, and memory usage.

Use the agent host info API operations to get information about
the host environment, resources, and logged in users.
