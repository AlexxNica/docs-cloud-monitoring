General API Information
--------------------------

The Rackspace Cloud Monitoring API is implemented by using a RESTful web service
interface. Cloud Big Data shares a common token-based authentication system with other
products in the Rackspace Cloud suite. This system enables seamless access between
Rackspace products and services.

.. note::
   All requests to authenticate and operate against the Rackspace Cloud Monitoring API
   are performed using SSL over HTTPS on TCP port 443.
