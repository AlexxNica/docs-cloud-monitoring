The Rackspace Monitoring command-line interface (CLI), known as raxmon, lets
you interact with the Rackspace CMonitoring API in a quick and
efficient manner. If you're not a programmer, consider using raxmon to
become familiar with the product and its capabilities. Even if you have
programming experience, you might like the speed at which you can set up
monitors by using raxmon.

You can use the Rackspace Monitoring CLI, raxmon, for this tutorial. You
install and run raxmon on your local workstation (not on the servers
that you plan to monitor). You can learn more about raxmon at
`rackspace-monitoring-cli <https://github.com/racker/rackspace-monitoring-cli>`__
on github.

..  note::
      Raxmon is not designed to work on a Windows OS.
